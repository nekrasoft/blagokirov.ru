### Repo: blagokirov.ru — quick instructions for AI coding agents

This is a small static + PHP site for a local business (БлагоСервис). The site is served from plain PHP/HTML files and assets in `assets/`.

Keep edits small and low-risk. Prefer changes to `includes/` and root HTML/PHP pages. Do NOT modify prebuilt/minified bundles in `assets/`.

Key locations
- `includes/` — shared PHP includes: `config.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`, form handlers. Global constants and strings live in `includes/config.php`.
- Root pages (`index.htm`, `index.php`, `arenda-kontejnerov/index.php`, etc.) — page templates (often exported from Elementor/TenWeb).
- `assets/` — compiled vendor/theme bundles and images. Do not edit `*.min.js`/`*.min.css`.
- `services.yml` — Yandex/YML catalog used for Yandex services. Small edits here are common (offers/sets/categories).

Patterns & conventions
- Centralized strings: update phones, SITE_URL, image constants in `includes/config.php` rather than find/replace across pages.
- When adding a global UI change (header/footer, meta tags), edit `includes/header.php`/`includes/footer.php`.
- New small components: create an include in `includes/` (e.g., `includes/new-form.php`) and include from pages.
- Forms: follow existing AJAX pattern — forms POST to `includes/*.php` handlers and return JSON with Content-Type header. Copy validation pattern from `form-handler.php`.

Assets & images
- Never recompile `assets/*.min.*`. If you need a CSS tweak, add a small CSS file and reference it after existing CSS in `includes/header.php`.
- Use existing images from `assets/` (e.g., `assets/blago-truck.png`, `assets/demontazh.jpg`, `assets/raschistka.jpg`) when updating feeds like `services.yml`.

Yandex/YML specific notes (important)
- `services.yml` is actually an XML YML catalog (Yandex Market/Services style). Keep XML structure and valid encoding header at top.
- When adding offers:
  - Ensure unique `<offer><name>` values (Yandex rejects duplicate names: DupOfferName).
  - Provide multiple offers/sets per service (Yandex may complain about insufficient suggestions).
  - Validate by parsing with an XML parser (e.g., `php -r "simplexml_load_file('services.yml');"` or a quick PowerShell `[xml]` cast).

Developer workflows
- There are no build scripts; avoid adding Node/PHP build steps unless requested.
- Quick local sanity checks:
  - PHP lint: `php -l includes/header.php` (use when editing PHP includes).
  - XML parse with PowerShell: `[xml](Get-Content services.yml)` (used during edits to `services.yml`).

Testing & safety
- Keep changes minimal and backward-compatible. The site runs on simple PHP hosting.
- When changing PHP files, run `php -l` on the edited file. When editing `services.yml`, parse it as XML.

Examples (copyable patterns)
- Add a phone: edit `includes/config.php` and add `define('PHONE_4', '+7...');` then include it in `includes/header.php`.
- New AJAX form: create `includes/my-form.php` for markup + JS (follow `callback-form.php`), and `includes/my-form-handler.php` for POST/JSON response.

If something isn't discoverable here (CI, deploy user tokens, or external APIs), ask the repo owner for the missing details instead of guessing.

If this file already exists, merge by preserving any repo-owner notes and update only the project-specific sections above.

If you want, I can shorten or expand any section, or add quick examples for `includes/config.php` or `services.yml` edits.
### Repo context & quick goals

- This repository is a small static + PHP website for a local business (БлагоСервис) served from plain PHP/HTML files. The core files are root HTML pages (e.g. `index.htm`) and PHP include-based templates in `includes/` (notably `config.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`). Assets live under `assets/`.

### High-level architecture

- Presentation: mostly static HTML generated by exported Elementor/tenweb templates (`index.htm`, `arenda-kontejnerov/index.php`, `demontazh-postroek/index.php`, etc.).
- PHP layer: `includes/` contains a minimal PHP site wrapper used in the PHP version — `config.php` centralizes constants (phones, SITE_URL, images); `header.php` and `footer.php` are shared templates.
- Client-side: UI and forms use vanilla JS + bundled libraries in `assets/` (jQuery, TenWeb scripts). Forms post to server-side handlers in `includes/` (e.g., `form-handler.php`, `contact-form-handler.php`).

### Goals for an AI coding agent working here

- Make small, low-risk changes to markup/CSS and localization strings in `includes/config.php`.
- Preserve inline/compiled `assets/*.min.*` bundles — avoid re-bundling. Prefer small edits (styles, HTML templates, PHP constants).
- When adding new dynamic behavior, follow current patterns: create small PHP include components inside `includes/` and reference them from page templates.

### Conventions & patterns to follow

- Strings and site-wide values live in `includes/config.php` as PHP defines (e.g., `PHONE_1`, `SITE_URL`, `TRUCK_IMAGE`). Update these constants instead of searching and replacing literals across files.
- Header/footer are canonical: modify `includes/header.php` and `includes/footer.php` for global layout changes. Pages often include these to render consistent meta tags and structured data.
- Form handling: AJAX forms post to `includes/*.php` handlers and return JSON; handlers set `Content-Type: application/json` and HTTP status codes. Mirror this pattern for new endpoints.
- Client JS uses simple fetch/XHR; prefer adding small vanilla JS modules or inline scripts near the component (see `includes/callback-form.php`) instead of adding new heavy dependencies.

### Coding rules & safety

- Do not alter or regenerate `assets/*.min.js`/`*.min.css`. These are compiled vendor/theme bundles. Small CSS tweaks go into PHP templates or new CSS files linked after the existing CSS.
- Keep changes backward-compatible: the site is likely served on simple PHP hosting. Avoid requiring Composer, NPM, or build steps unless explicitly requested.

### Useful file references (examples)

- Site constants: `includes/config.php` (phones, SITE_URL, TRUCK_IMAGE, COMMERCIAL_PROPOSAL_PDF)
- Shared layout: `includes/header.php`, `includes/footer.php` (meta tags, structured data, CSS includes, GTM/Yandex)
- Form component: `includes/callback-form.php` (markup + JS phone mask + fetch to `includes/form-handler.php`)
- Form handlers: `includes/form-handler.php`, `includes/contact-form-handler.php` (POST-only, validate, mail/send JSON)
- Primary HTML entry: `index.htm` (exported Elementor template; use as reference for markup and classes when editing)

### When changing tests, builds, or deployment

- No repo-level build/test scripts detected. Do not add heavy CI unless the user requests it. Simple sanity checks: run PHP lint (php -l) on edited PHP files and validate HTML with a local browser.

### Example tasks and how to implement

- Add a new phone number: update `includes/config.php` (define PHONE_4), then add link markup in `includes/header.php` / `includes/footer.php`.
- Create a new AJAX form: add `includes/new-form.php` for markup/JS, then `includes/new-form-handler.php` that returns JSON and uses the same header and mail pattern as `form-handler.php`.

### What not to change

- Do not modify minified 3rd-party assets in `assets/` or attempt to rebuild them.
- Avoid touching GTM/Yandex snippets unless asked — these are used for analytics.

If anything in these notes is unclear or you'd like examples for a specific change (e.g., add a page, update meta tags, add an API endpoint), tell me which task and I will update or expand this file.
