### Repo context & quick goals

- This repository is a small static + PHP website for a local business (БлагоСервис) served from plain PHP/HTML files. The core files are root HTML pages (e.g. `index.htm`) and PHP include-based templates in `includes/` (notably `config.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`). Assets live under `assets/`.

### High-level architecture

- Presentation: mostly static HTML generated by exported Elementor/tenweb templates (`index.htm`, `arenda-kontejnerov/index.php`, `demontazh-postroek/index.php`, etc.).
- PHP layer: `includes/` contains a minimal PHP site wrapper used in the PHP version — `config.php` centralizes constants (phones, SITE_URL, images); `header.php` and `footer.php` are shared templates.
- Client-side: UI and forms use vanilla JS + bundled libraries in `assets/` (jQuery, TenWeb scripts). Forms post to server-side handlers in `includes/` (e.g., `form-handler.php`, `contact-form-handler.php`).

### Goals for an AI coding agent working here

- Make small, low-risk changes to markup/CSS and localization strings in `includes/config.php`.
- Preserve inline/compiled `assets/*.min.*` bundles — avoid re-bundling. Prefer small edits (styles, HTML templates, PHP constants).
- When adding new dynamic behavior, follow current patterns: create small PHP include components inside `includes/` and reference them from page templates.

### Conventions & patterns to follow

- Strings and site-wide values live in `includes/config.php` as PHP defines (e.g., `PHONE_1`, `SITE_URL`, `TRUCK_IMAGE`). Update these constants instead of searching and replacing literals across files.
- Header/footer are canonical: modify `includes/header.php` and `includes/footer.php` for global layout changes. Pages often include these to render consistent meta tags and structured data.
- Form handling: AJAX forms post to `includes/*.php` handlers and return JSON; handlers set `Content-Type: application/json` and HTTP status codes. Mirror this pattern for new endpoints.
- Client JS uses simple fetch/XHR; prefer adding small vanilla JS modules or inline scripts near the component (see `includes/callback-form.php`) instead of adding new heavy dependencies.

### Coding rules & safety

- Do not alter or regenerate `assets/*.min.js`/`*.min.css`. These are compiled vendor/theme bundles. Small CSS tweaks go into PHP templates or new CSS files linked after the existing CSS.
- Keep changes backward-compatible: the site is likely served on simple PHP hosting. Avoid requiring Composer, NPM, or build steps unless explicitly requested.

### Useful file references (examples)

- Site constants: `includes/config.php` (phones, SITE_URL, TRUCK_IMAGE, COMMERCIAL_PROPOSAL_PDF)
- Shared layout: `includes/header.php`, `includes/footer.php` (meta tags, structured data, CSS includes, GTM/Yandex)
- Form component: `includes/callback-form.php` (markup + JS phone mask + fetch to `includes/form-handler.php`)
- Form handlers: `includes/form-handler.php`, `includes/contact-form-handler.php` (POST-only, validate, mail/send JSON)
- Primary HTML entry: `index.htm` (exported Elementor template; use as reference for markup and classes when editing)

### When changing tests, builds, or deployment

- No repo-level build/test scripts detected. Do not add heavy CI unless the user requests it. Simple sanity checks: run PHP lint (php -l) on edited PHP files and validate HTML with a local browser.

### Example tasks and how to implement

- Add a new phone number: update `includes/config.php` (define PHONE_4), then add link markup in `includes/header.php` / `includes/footer.php`.
- Create a new AJAX form: add `includes/new-form.php` for markup/JS, then `includes/new-form-handler.php` that returns JSON and uses the same header and mail pattern as `form-handler.php`.

### What not to change

- Do not modify minified 3rd-party assets in `assets/` or attempt to rebuild them.
- Avoid touching GTM/Yandex snippets unless asked — these are used for analytics.

If anything in these notes is unclear or you'd like examples for a specific change (e.g., add a page, update meta tags, add an API endpoint), tell me which task and I will update or expand this file.
